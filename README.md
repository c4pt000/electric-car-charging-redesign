Tesla CEO and prolific meme thief Elon Musk is allegedly planning to release a fully-autonomous budget Tesla with no steering wheel or pedals.
```
Keep the steering wheel and floor pedals no matter what, in case the onboard computer ever fails
to be able to switch into manual driving mode, if the computer breaks from electronic circumvention or from heating up from the sun on the dashboard
The driver should be able to switch into manual driving mode just in case
```

```
This is not necessary since an air compressor would be a more realistic 
Windshield wiperless design for an air compressor can 
Definitely push droplets of moisture clean off of a flat or
Semi curved surface even a windshield if the air is pressurized
At a given angle through an exit as it moves the droplets of
Water in an outward direction from the base of the windshield
In layman's terms very similar to the end of a car wash 
Exiting from the hood of the car against the windshield
As it rains

# gas station can install speed bumps next to pump run wire (underneath the speed bump)

# test in desert near MOAB first for UL safety gas can ignite

# cycles can charge with kickstand cathode and anode on circular charging plate left and right positive and negative contacts
# also test MOAB ,...cyclist shouldn't turn into a burning man desert stunt use regular crash test dummy man ....little bmw circles on his head

# even burning o2 from the surrounding air by pulling in the air cleaning it releasing 50% volume as clean o2 and combusting the other 50% volume o2 to power an internal generator supplying the vehicle with electric energy
# by gathering the surrounding air into an internal compressed air tank and passing the air
# through a looping filter each pass through the filter separates the air into o2
# like carbon separation of co2 by capturing carbon through a multi pass pressured loop a few dozen times back through the filter 
# each pass the carbon is captured increasing the output of o2


# o2 is collected as the final result and 50% percent of the collected final result is emitted back out of the vehicle as a form of clean air

# leaving the hybrid gas station electric speed bump as an affordable option for $5 for 15 minutes rapid charge as an option
# not every electric car user will feel comfortable driving off of the surrounding air 
# it can be left as an option and as the customers choice to just pull in the surrounding air and clean it with carbon separation to release clean o2 and if that option is selected then the vehicle will rely on using an electric charging station at the time of purchase at the customers car dealership

# as a choice the vehicles source of energy for the car can switch between two modes of being able to utilize electricity either from the air or from a charging station either choice the vehicle will be equiped to pull in surrounding air and clean it as a form of carbon scrubbing
# to help the environment at the time of purchase or lease



ot
this could be the same for electric cycles?@
