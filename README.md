Tesla CEO and prolific meme thief Elon Musk is allegedly planning to release a fully-autonomous budget Tesla with no steering wheel or pedals.
```
Keep the steering wheel and floor pedals no matter what, in case the onboard computer ever fails
to be able to switch into manual driving mode, if the computer breaks from electronic circumvention or from heating up from the sun on the dashboard
The driver should be able to switch into manual driving mode just in case
```

```
This is not necessary since an air compressor would be a more realistic 
Windshield wiperless design for an air compressor can 
Definitely push droplets of moisture clean off of a flat or
Semi curved surface even a windshield if the air is pressurized
At a given angle through an exit as it moves the droplets of
Water in an outward direction from the base of the windshield
In layman's terms very similar to the end of a car wash 
Exiting from the hood of the car against the windshield
As it rains

# gas station can install speed bumps next to pump run wire

# test in desert near MOAB first for UL safety gas can ignite

# cycles can charge with kickstand cathode and anode on circular charging plate left and right positive and negative contacts
# also test MOAB ,...cyclist shouldn't turn into a burning man desert stunt use regular crash test dummy man ....little bmw circles on his head
