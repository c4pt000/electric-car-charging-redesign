Tesla CEO and prolific meme thief Elon Musk is allegedly planning to release a fully-autonomous budget Tesla with no steering wheel or pedals.
```
Keep the steering wheel and floor pedals no matter what, in case the onboard computer ever fails
to be able to switch into manual driving mode, if the computer breaks from electronic circumvention or from heating up from the sun on the dashboard
The driver should be able to switch into manual driving mode just in case
```

```
This is not necessary since an air compressor would be a more realistic 
Windshield wiperless design for an air compressor can 
Definitely push droplets of moisture clean off of a flat or
Semi curved surface even a windshield if the air is pressurized
At a given angle through an exit as it moves the droplets of
Water in an outward direction from the base of the windshield
In layman's terms very similar to the end of a car wash 
Exiting from the hood of the car against the windshield
As it rains

# gas station can install speed bumps next to pump run wire (underneath the speed bump)

# test in desert near MOAB first for UL safety gas can ignite

# cycles can charge with kickstand cathode and anode on circular charging plate left and right positive and negative contacts
# also test MOAB ,...cyclist shouldn't turn into a burning man desert stunt use regular crash test dummy man ....little bmw circles on his head

# even burning o2 from the surrounding air by pulling in the air cleaning it releasing 50% volume as clean o2 and combusting the other 50% volume o2 to power an internal generator
by gathering the surrounding air into an internal compressed air tank and passing the air
through a looping filter each pass through the filter separates the air into o2
like carbon separation of co2 by capturing carbon through a multi pass pressured loop a few dozen times
each pass the carbon is captured increasing the output of o2


o2 is collected as the final result and 50% percentage of the collected final result is emitted back out of the vehicle as a form of clean air
