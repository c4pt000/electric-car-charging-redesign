Recently, however, many scientists have suggested the air could be used as a propellant. Now, a team of
scientists from the George Washington University (GWU) and the US Department of Energy’s Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have teamed up to develop a proof of concept for an air-breathing satellite.

The very low Earth orbit’s untapped potential A satellite that uses air as a propellant could utilize
charged particles of air-breathing plasma – also known as the fourth state of matter – to propel its thrusters.
“There is air available at VLEOs. So, instead of launching rockets with these propellants, such as xenon,
krypton, or argon, we can use what is naturally available: air,” Yevgeny Raitses, a managing principal
research physicist at PPPL who is leading the Lab’s work on the project, explained in a press statement.

“This should allow us to reduce the mass of satellites or allow them to dedicate the difference in mass to
other aspects of the device,” he continued. “It might also extend the lifetime of the device.”

Traditional satellites in LEO and higher orbits have limited lifespans because they use a limited amount of
propellant to generate plasma. The thruster proposed by the GWU and PPPL team would avoid this problem by using
the surrounding air to generate plasma. In other words, any satellite using this system would essentially have free,
unlimited propellant.

Could air-breathing technology unlock unlimited propellant for satellites? 

Naturally, given the great potential of this project for low-cost satellite operations that will enable more
detailed imaging, it has garnered attention from the US government. In fact, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) has already provided $400,000 of an anticipated $1 million grant for the project. 

The GWU and PPPL teams aren’t the only ones researching air-breathing satellite technology. In an interview with IE
in 2022, Jan Mataró, CTO of Spanish company Kreios Space, explained that “right now, very low Earth orbit is an
unused orbit simply because of the lack of propulsion systems capable of staying in this orbit. But it could allow
for a huge increase in the resolution for both telecommunications and Earth observation.”

That company is developing an air-breathing generator for satellites that it claims will provide a 16x increase
resolution for Earth observation and telecommunications satellites.

Of course, some obstacles must be overcome before the technology is feasible. For example, the GWU and PPPL teams are
working to ensure that positive and negative particles released from their thruster leave at the same rate so there is
no net electric current in the plasma plume.

“It is important in order to avoid charging the satellites,” Raitses explained. In other words, a charged satellite could
cause charged particles to release from the thruster. These would be attracted back to the satellite and could cause a
damaging recoil effect. 

According to the team’s press statement, it is developing a thruster capable of neutralizing the particles and allowing
for smooth operation in VLEO.

Tesla CEO and prolific meme thief Elon Musk is allegedly planning to release a fully-autonomous budget Tesla with no steering wheel or pedals.
```
Keep the steering wheel and floor pedals no matter what, in case the onboard computer ever fails
to be able to switch into manual driving mode, if the computer breaks from electronic circumvention or from heating up from the sun on the dashboard
The driver should be able to switch into manual driving mode just in case

```
This is not necessary since an air compressor would be a more realistic 
Windshield wiperless design for an air compressor can 
Definitely push droplets of moisture clean off of a flat or
Semi curved surface even a windshield if the air is pressurized
At a given angle through an exit as it moves the droplets of
Water in an outward direction from the base of the windshield
In layman's terms very similar to the end of a car wash 
Exiting from the hood of the car against the windshield

# even burning o2 from the surrounding air by pulling in the air cleaning it releasing 50% volume as clean o2 and combusting the other 50% volume o2 to power an internal generator supplying the vehicle with electric energy
# by gathering the surrounding air into an internal compressed air tank and passing the air
# through a looping filter each pass through the filter separates the air into o2
# like carbon separation of co2 by capturing carbon through a multi pass pressured loop a few dozen times back through the filter 
# each pass the carbon is captured increasing the output of o2


# o2 is collected as the final result and 50% percent of the collected final result is emitted back out of the vehicle as a form of clean air

# leaving the hybrid gas station electric speed bump as an affordable option for $5 for 15 minutes rapid charge as an option
# not every electric car user will feel comfortable driving off of the surrounding air 
# it can be left as an option and as the customers choice to just pull in the surrounding air and clean it with carbon separation to release clean o2 and if that option is selected then the vehicle will rely on using an electric charging station at the time of purchase at the customers car dealership

# as a choice the vehicles source of energy for the car can switch between two modes of being able to utilize electricity either from the air or from a charging station either choice the vehicle will be equiped to pull in surrounding air and clean it as a form of carbon scrubbing
# to help the environment at the time of purchase or lease



ot
this could be the same for electric cycles?@




# 10-05-2021 this is a mistake waste of intelluctual energy methane burns twice as heavy as current fuel grades really bad idea interesting chemical processes but really bad idea
# https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200227114523.htm
# https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/slcps/methane

noticed a scientist or something wasting physical energy with processes 
unnecessarily making methane from CO2
guess i will mentally consider use of chemical process for this conversion or what it could be used for with requirements involving methane process since i have a basic chemistry level at chem 2 with no organic level
regular computer engineering burning just o2 is a cleaner burn for all applications that i mentioned with this psuedo design in my own personal disgust of chinese failed space craft not burning energy for free on mars so in my arrogance I elaborated my "free-energy" suggestion because of reading how idiotic completely outside of car energy design but my own arguments complaining about idiotic spacecraft

 in the news about the Chinese space race 
so i guess even re explaining the simplicity of it
finally being aggravated enough to REALLY elaborate here how it can power machinery on earth instead and redesign the energy sector on earth since reading of the Chinese space race to mars completely ignoring the abundance of co2 fuel on mars (since they burn coal mostly) and the spacecraft they built utilizes little to nothing of abundant co2 there as free electrical energy

really really bothering me outside of other terms then to read about the co2 to methane catalyst creation reaction of a catalyst reaction to make CH4 (methane) which is already too heavy of a fuel in terms of combustion exhaust and it's natural properties consistent of the components compromising greenhouse gas

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator

# How is oxygen manufactured for hospitals?
* One is by liquifying air through a process called cryogenic distillation. In this method, oxygen is produced in air separation plants where the air is cooled and the oxygen is distilled based on its boiling point. ...
# Oxygen can also be generated from the air itself by a machine called an oxygen concentrator.





# loosely figured -> 1kg of air 1L of air as 1000 grams where 10 grams are co2 on average

there are roughly 4 molecules co2 for every 10,000 molecules of air

~~~~~loose figure (0.0004) in Avogadro's number 6.022 * 10^23 molecules per mol
1kg.of air is 21 septillion molecules consisting of 850 quadrillion co2 molecules


```
a regular vehicle would require a 300 liter storage tank to hold 300kg of air

resulting in 3kg of co2 from the air when extracting combustible o2 leaves 2kg (liters)


2L is half a gallon


an average gallon yields 22 miles (per gallon)


so around 11 miles per half a gallon on a loose based average




the vehicles onboard 300kg storage tank would have to refill with air and separate to o2 every 15 minutes to yield 


8L of o2 an hour


a secondary storage tank of 300kg would hold purified o2 


to feed 8L of combustible o2 an hour



or 150L tank

and another 150L 


tank 


for 4L an hour being fed into the secondary tank to fuel the electric vehicles onboard generator to power the vehicle





a regular consumer gas electric generator usage compared to combustion from the surrounding air





5 kilowatt / 5 for 1 kilowatt


0.75 gallons is 3 liters




600 grams is 1/5 of 3 liters


is almost half a liter since a liter is 1000g


it would require half a liter an hour to power 1 kilowatt~


instead of 3 liters to power 5 kilowatt



in 15 minutes

50kg of air 500 grams of co2

30 minutes

100kg of air is 1000 grams of co2

60 minutes

2 liters of co2


in 15 minutes

500 grams is 330 grams of o2

1/3 of a liter of fuel


in 30 minutes

1000 grams is 660 grams of o2

1/2 of a liter (500g) of o2


in 60 minutes

2000 grams is 1.32 liters of o2
