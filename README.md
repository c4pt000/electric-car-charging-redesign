Tesla CEO and prolific meme thief Elon Musk is allegedly planning to release a fully-autonomous budget Tesla with no steering wheel or pedals.
```
Keep the steering wheel and floor pedals no matter what, in case the onboard computer ever fails
to be able to switch into manual driving mode, if the computer breaks from electronic circumvention or from heating up from the sun on the dashboard
The driver should be able to switch into manual driving mode just in case
```

```
This is not necessary since an air compressor would be a more realistic 
Windshield wiperless design for an air compressor can 
Definitely push droplets of moisture clean off of a flat or
Semi curved surface even a windshield if the air is pressurized
At a given angle through an exit as it moves the droplets of
Water in an outward direction from the base of the windshield
In layman's terms very similar to the end of a car wash 
Exiting from the hood of the car against the windshield
As it rains

# gas station can install speed bumps next to pump run wire (underneath the speed bump)

# test in desert near MOAB first for UL safety gas can ignite

# cycles can charge with kickstand cathode and anode on circular charging plate left and right positive and negative contacts
# also test MOAB ,...cyclist shouldn't turn into a burning man desert stunt use regular crash test dummy man ....little bmw circles on his head

# even burning o2 from the surrounding air by pulling in the air cleaning it releasing 50% volume as clean o2 and combusting the other 50% volume o2 to power an internal generator supplying the vehicle with electric energy
# by gathering the surrounding air into an internal compressed air tank and passing the air
# through a looping filter each pass through the filter separates the air into o2
# like carbon separation of co2 by capturing carbon through a multi pass pressured loop a few dozen times back through the filter 
# each pass the carbon is captured increasing the output of o2


# o2 is collected as the final result and 50% percent of the collected final result is emitted back out of the vehicle as a form of clean air

# leaving the hybrid gas station electric speed bump as an affordable option for $5 for 15 minutes rapid charge as an option
# not every electric car user will feel comfortable driving off of the surrounding air 
# it can be left as an option and as the customers choice to just pull in the surrounding air and clean it with carbon separation to release clean o2 and if that option is selected then the vehicle will rely on using an electric charging station at the time of purchase at the customers car dealership

# as a choice the vehicles source of energy for the car can switch between two modes of being able to utilize electricity either from the air or from a charging station either choice the vehicle will be equiped to pull in surrounding air and clean it as a form of carbon scrubbing
# to help the environment at the time of purchase or lease



ot
this could be the same for electric cycles?@




# 10-05-2021 this is a mistake waste of intelluctual energy methane burns twice as heavy as current fuel grades really bad idea interesting chemical processes but really bad idea

noticed a scientist or something wasting physical energy with processes 
unnecessarily making methane from CO2
guess i will mentally consider use of chemical process for this conversion or what it could be used for with requirements involving methane process since i have a basic chemistry level at chem 2 with no organic level
regular computer engineering burning just o2 is a cleaner burn for all applications that i mentioned with this psuedo design in my own personal disgust of chinese failed space craft not burning energy for free on mars so in my arrogance I elaborated my "free-energy" suggestion because of reading how idiotic completely outside of car energy design but my own arguments complaining about idiotic spacecraft

 in the news about the Chinese space race 
so i guess even re explaining the simplicity of it
finally being aggravated enough to REALLY elaborate here how it can power machinery on earth instead and redesign the energy sector on earth since reading of the Chinese space race to mars completely ignoring the abundance of co2 fuel on mars (since they burn coal mostly) and the spacecraft they built utilizes little to nothing of abundant co2 there as free electrical energy

really really bothering me outside of other terms then to read about the co2 to methane catalyst creation reaction of a catalyst reaction to make CH4 (methane) which is already too heavy of a fuel in terms of combustion exhaust and it's natural properties consistent of the components compromising greenhouse gas

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator

# How is oxygen manufactured for hospitals?
# One is by liquifying air through a process called cryogenic distillation. In this method, oxygen is produced in air separation plants where the air is cooled and the oxygen is distilled based on its boiling point. ... Oxygen can also be generated from the air itself by a machine called an oxygen concentrator.
